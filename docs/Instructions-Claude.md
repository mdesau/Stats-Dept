# Instructions — Stats-Dept (LLM Working Context)

> Purpose: mitigate context loss between sessions. Read this first when resuming
> work. Update the **Current State** section at the end of each working session.

---

## Current State

- **Repo version:** `1.1.0` (working toward `1.2.0` — see below).
- **Last commit:** `feat: add StatsImport duplicate detection` (docs move landed
  just before it).
- **Last release tag:** `v1.1.0`.
- **Uncommitted work:** none — duplicate-detection feature and docs move are both
  committed. **Not yet pushed to clasp / live-tested** (see Code status).
- **Tagging policy:** tag every release that contains anything beyond pure doc
  updates (code/config/bug fixes) with a SemVer patch/minor bump. Doc-only
  changes stay under `[Unreleased]` with no tag.
- **Standards:** `PRACTICES-AND-PRINCIPLES.md` is now the source of truth for how
  we author/document/version/hand off code. Read it alongside this file.
- **Code status:** Authoritative Apps Script source is now tracked under the
  simplified active filenames `StatsUpdate/StatsUpdate.js` and
  `StatsImport/StatsImport-and-Align.js`. Deprecated StatsImport legacy files
  were removed from the tracked project and cloud script so local, GitHub, and
  Apps Script now share the same lean file set. StatsUpdate now includes Juniors
  in `updateStatsFromRegistrations()` with `Draft = "Juniors"` (no longer excluded).
  **NEW:** StatsImport gained a duplicate-detection component
  (`StatsImport/DuplicateDetection.js`) wired into `aggregateAndAlignStats()`; it
  warns + confirms before appending a possibly re-imported team to `Raw_Stats`.
  ⚠️ **Still needs `clasp push --user gamechanger` + a live import test** before
  it is tagged as `1.2.0`.
- **Documentation status:** 
  - All docs except `README.md` now live under `docs/`.
  - README.md updated with "Seasonal Operations Workflow" section (concise SOP)
  - `How To Build Draft Stats.docx` committed (full procedural guide with screenshots)
- **Next phase priority:** live-test + push duplicate detection (→ tag `1.2.0`),
  then the StatsImport code-quality assessment (see "Active Task" below)

### Accounts (IMPORTANT)
Both **production** projects are owned/accessed via the org account
**gamechanger@wcwaabaseball.org** (clasp named user `gamechanger`). An earlier
version of these notes wrongly listed StatsUpdate under `mdesau@gmail.com`; that
was an **orphan copy** (`12Auuw3…`), not the live script — see BUG-004.

- `StatsUpdate` (prod `1HyMi6t…`) → **gamechanger@wcwaabaseball.org**
- `StatsImport` (prod)            → **gamechanger@wcwaabaseball.org**

> `mdesau@gmail.com` remains the clasp **default** user and still owns the
> unused orphan StatsUpdate copy `12Auuw3…` (safe to ignore/delete).

Sync commands — **both** projects require the named user:
```bash
# StatsUpdate (production, org account)
cd StatsUpdate && clasp pull --user gamechanger

# StatsImport (org account)
cd StatsImport && clasp pull --user gamechanger
```
If a push/pull fails with `invalid_grant` / `invalid_rapt`, the token expired —
re-run `clasp login --user gamechanger`.

## Active Task (Priority)

**Post-1.0.0: StatsImport code-quality assessment**

The migration gate is **DONE** — `v1.0.0` shipped on 2026-07-09 with both projects
verified end-to-end in the clasp workflow. Next up is the first item on the
post-1.0.0 roadmap: a deep-dive on `StatsImport/StatsImport-and-Align.js`
against `PRACTICES-AND-PRINCIPLES.md` to decide whether a refactor/optimization is
warranted.

**Context:**
- Two projects: `StatsImport` (Stats Align Pipeline, v6.3) and `StatsUpdate`
  (AutoUpdate Regs to Stats, v2.4) — both now at repo version `1.0.0`.
- StatsUpdate received focused fixes this migration (BUG-003/004/005);
  StatsImport has not yet had a standards pass.

**Approach:**
1. Read `StatsImport-and-Align.js` against the practices doc.
2. Log any defects in `BUGS.md`; capture improvement ideas as roadmap items.
3. Propose (don't auto-apply) a refactor plan; discuss tradeoffs before changing code.

**Expected outcome:**
- A shared understanding of StatsImport's health and a prioritized improvement plan.

**SemVer from here:** we are past `1.0.0`, so strict SemVer applies — breaking
changes bump MAJOR, backwards-compatible features bump MINOR, fixes bump PATCH.

## To Do / Roadmap

Non-bug, forward-looking tasks for the migration. (Actual defects go in `BUGS.md`.)

- [x] **⭐ Verify + test each project in its new (clasp) workflow (DONE →
  `v1.0.0`, 2026-07-09).** Both projects confirmed working end-to-end; this gate
  ended the migration phase and cut the first stable release.
- [ ] **⭐ Code assessment: StatsImport (NEXT PRIORITY).** Deep-dive on
  `StatsImport-and-Align.js` against `PRACTICES-AND-PRINCIPLES.md`.
  Determine if refactor/optimization is warranted. *See "Active Task" above.*
- [ ] **Account consolidation (decide + execute).** The two projects are owned by
  different Google accounts (`mdesau@gmail.com` vs `gamechanger@wcwaabaseball.org`).
  Everything works today via clasp named users, but the org account creates a
  continuity/bus-factor risk (losing org access = losing owner control of
  StatsImport, its Script Properties incl. `GEMINI_API_KEY`, and triggers).
  Options to weigh (each touches live production):
    1. Transfer ownership of the StatsImport **Sheet** (container-bound script
       moves with its Sheet); may be blocked by org cross-domain policy.
    2. "Make a copy" under the target account — creates a **new Script ID** and
       does **not** carry over Script Properties or triggers (needs re-setup).
    3. Leave as-is and simply guarantee durable access to the org account.
- [x] **Reconcile legacy in-file changelogs** into the single `CHANGELOG.md`
  (done — preserved verbatim in the "Pre-migration project history" section;
  keep it tidy as new changes land under `[Unreleased]`).
- [x] **Rename script files to drop stale version labels.** Done 2026-07-09:
  `StatsUpdate/StatsUpdate.js` and `StatsImport/StatsImport-and-Align.js` are now
  the active file names, and the deprecated `v4.6` / `v5.0` StatsImport files
  were removed so the cloud project mirrors the simplified repo layout.
- [x] **Review "Cleared (unregistered)" player logic.** In
  `updateStatsFromRegistrations()` (StatsUpdate), audit how players who are no
  longer in the current Registrations get their draft fields cleared. *Reviewed
  and RESOLVED: confirmed the gap — exact full-name matching wrongly clears a
  registered player and re-adds a duplicate when the name is spelled differently
  (BUG-005).* **Resolution (v0.1.5, accepted in v1.0.0):** review-only detection
  (`findPossibleNameMismatches()`) flags cleared↔added same-last-name pairs in the
  popup/log for human verification — no data is auto-changed. **Optional future
  enhancement** (not an open defect): normalize the match key (lowercase + collapse
  whitespace + strip punctuation); consider a fuzzy fallback only if normalization
  proves insufficient (higher collateral-damage risk).
- [ ] Only after the above: consider actual code changes (a new, separate phase).
- [ ] **🚀 Major change / Feature (targets `2.0.0`): bulk import from folder.**
  Investigate the ability to implement a "bulk import" feature that ingests
  multiple coach CSVs directly from a folder (e.g. Google Drive) in one run,
  rather than one file at a time. Breaking/behavior-changing scope → will land
  as a `2.0.0` release when built.
- [ ] **StatsUpdate AI Scout follow-up (deferred).** Verify/restore the
  Scouting Assistant dialog handlers (`showAiScoutInputDialog`,
  `showAiScoutDialog`, `showAiDialog`) in the active script layout so the menu
  path is fully wired before enabling broader AI Scout work.

## Architecture / Projects

Two Apps Script projects, one repo, one pipeline:

| Folder | Project | Internal Ver | Owner account | Role |
|--------|---------|--------------|---------------|------|
| `StatsImport/` | Stats Align Pipeline | 6.3 | gamechanger@wcwaabaseball.org | Normalize coach CSVs → `Raw_Stats` |
| `StatsUpdate/` | AutoUpdate Regs to Stats (+ Mock Draft) | 2.4 | gamechanger@wcwaabaseball.org | Sync → `Draft_Stats`; AI tools |

`StatsImport/` now keeps only the active import pipeline source file plus the
manifest/config needed for clasp sync.

### Data dependencies (one-line flow)
`Coach CSVs → StatsImport(aggregateAndAlignStats) → Raw_Stats → StatsUpdate(updateStatsFromRegistrations) → Draft_Stats → AI Scout / Mock Draft / Evals`

## Function Map

### StatsImport — Stats Align Pipeline (`StatsImport-and-Align`)
| Function | What it does |
|----------|--------------|
| `onOpen` | Builds the "GC Automation" Sheets menu |
| `aggregateAndAlignStats` | Main entry: header detection + tiered mapping + append to Raw_Stats |
| `callBatchResidualAI` | Single Gemini call to map all unknown/residual stat headers |
| `generateAISectionProfile` | AI labels Batting/Pitching/Fielding zones for 1-row headers |
| `processPlayerData` | Filters junk rows, aligns player rows to master columns |

|----------|--------------|
| `confirmNoDuplicatesOrAbort` | Orchestrator called by `aggregateAndAlignStats()`: reads existing `Raw_Stats`, detects duplicates, shows the Yes/No dialog, logs on cancel, returns proceed/abort |
| `detectDuplicates` | Pure: classifies incoming rows as exact re-import (identity + AVG) vs identity-only (possible update) |
| `buildIdentityKey` | Pure: builds `number|last|first` identity key from a master-model row |
| `normToken` | Pure: normalizes a cell (trim/lowercase/collapse whitespace) for comparison |
| `resolveAvgColumn` | Finds the batting AVG master column index (tolerant of header variants) |

### StatsUpdate — AutoUpdate Regs to Stats (`StatsUpdate`)
| Function | What it does |
|----------|--------------|
| `onOpen` | Builds the Sheets automation menu |
| `updateStatsFromRegistrations` | Core sync: Registrations/Challenge → Draft_Stats |

| `fuzzyFirstNameMatch` / `levenshteinDistance` | Fuzzy name matching |
| `logDebug` | Debug logger gated by DEBUG_FLAGS |

### StatsUpdate — Mock Draft (`MockDraft` + `MockDraftDialog.html`)
| Function | What it does |
|----------|--------------|
| `showMockDraftDialog` | Opens the Mock Draft wizard modal (HTML) |
| `findHeaderRow` | Locates the header row in a division sheet |
| `getDivisionSeasons` / `getDivisionStatColumns` | Populate wizard dropdowns |

## clasp quick reference
```bash
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"   # node/clasp live under Homebrew
clasp pull --user gamechanger   # inside StatsUpdate/  (production 1HyMi6t…, org account)
clasp pull --user gamechanger   # inside StatsImport/  (org account)
clasp push --user gamechanger   # send local → cloud (deliberate; org account)
clasp login --user gamechanger  # refresh token if invalid_grant / invalid_rapt
clasp open-script         # open the cloud project in the editor
```

## Security notes
- Gemini key comes from Script Properties `GEMINI_API_KEY` (never hardcoded).
- Verified: no `AIza...` keys or inline secret assignments in the code.
- clasp OAuth tokens live in `~/.clasprc.json` (git-ignored, never committed).

## Session handoff protocol
1. Update **Current State** (version, last commit, uncommitted work).
2. Log notable changes in `CHANGELOG.md` under `[Unreleased]`.
3. Log/append any bugs in `BUGS.md`.
4. Commit with a conventional message (`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`).
5. Push to `origin`. Tag only when cutting a release.
